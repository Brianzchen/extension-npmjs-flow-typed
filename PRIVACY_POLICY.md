# Privacy Policy

We takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

## Collection of Routine Information

This extension when run on npmjs.com does not collect any data and only takes the current url to determine the package to do a lookup and apply the flow-typed icon if applicable. No personally identifiable information is collected for this application.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
